# Blog Platform API

## Overview

The **Blog Platform API** is a backend service that powers a blogging platform. It allows users to create, update, delete, and view blogs. The system uses **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**, and **TypeScript** for its backend implementation. 

The platform distinguishes between **Admin** and **User** roles, where Admins have additional privileges such as managing users and blogs. Regular Users can manage their own blogs. The API ensures secure authentication, role-based access control, and supports public access to view blogs with advanced search, filtering, and sorting options.
